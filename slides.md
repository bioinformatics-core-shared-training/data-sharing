# Why sharing is important?

![](images/sharing.png) <!-- .element height="60%" width="60%" -->

----
# Some other very important reasons to share

- Open Research is fundamental to being an academic
- Research relies on the principle that we share our findings
- Ideas and results need to be shared to move our knowledge forward

----
# Open Access policies to publications
![](images/cruk.png)

You must ensure:

- An electronic copy of final, published form of your paper is **available on [Europe PubMed Central (Europe PMC)](https://europepmc.org/)** as soon as possible and no later than 6 months after publication.

----

- Your paper must be **published with a ![CC-BY](images/ccby.png) license**, so that it may be freely copied and reused, providing that the original authors are properly credited. Other licenses will not be compliant with your Grant Conditions.
- The journal must also belong to a publisher who has agreed to the [Wellcome Trust publisher requirements](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/publisher-requirements).

# What data to share?

- papers
  - results and figures
- processed data
- raw data and associated metadata
- methods used
- software and scripts

----
# Open Access journals

![](images/doaj.jpg)

https://doaj.org/

DOAJ is a community-curated online directory that indexes and provides access to **high quality, open access, peer-reviewed journals**.

----
# What about non-positive results?

https://riojournal.com/

RIO - Research Ideas and Outcomes - journal publishes all outputs of the research cycle

----

- [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/) is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal for descriptions of scientifically valuable datasets, and research that advances the sharing and reuse of scientific data.

- Pre-register your study in particular journals

# When to share?

![](images/closetoopendata.png)

----
# Would you consider Pre-Print?

http://www.biorxiv.org/

![](images/biorxiv.png)

By posting preprints on bioRxiv, authors are able to make their findings immediately available to the scientific community and receive feedback on draft manuscripts before they are submitted to journals.

----
# Making your publication Open Access

https://www.openaccess.cam.ac.uk/

The Open Access Team will check your funder and journal policies and advise on how to comply with Open Access requirements.

# How to share data?

Store, describe and deposit your data in **suitable** public data repositories and add a **link to your data** in your publication

![](images/warning.png) with exceptions for personal and sensitive data: do not collect it! Use anonymized data instead.

----
# Gather information early

- Think of data submission from the start
- Collect metadata before submission
- Keep a ReadMe file about your project
- Consider using an electronic notebook
