- If you've paid an article processing charge for the Europe PMC deposit, your paper must be published with a ![CC-BY](images/ccby.png) license, so that it may be freely copied and reused, providing that the original authors are properly credited. Other licenses will not be compliant with your Grant Conditions.
- The journal you publish in must be published by a publisher who has agreed to the [Wellcome Trust publisher requirements](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/publisher-requirements).
